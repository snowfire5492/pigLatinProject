/* 
 * Chapter No. 1    Excercise No. 1
 * File Name: PigLatinProject.java
 * @author: Eric Schenck
 * Date: September 2, 2012
 * 
 * Problem Statement: Ask the user to input their first name, then their last 
 * name. convert the first and last name to pig latin by taking the first letter
 * of each name and placing that letter at the end, adding "ay" to the end of 
 * that, and capitalize the first letter of the newly created names. print out 
 * the results along with a messege.
 * 
 * 
 * Overall plan:
 * 1.) Print an initial welcoming message to the screen
 * 2.) Prompt the user to enter their first, then last name.
 * 3.) move the first letter to the end of each name
 * 4.) add "ay" to the end of the name
 * 5.) capitalize the first letter of the name
 * 6.) print out the new pig latin version of the user name
